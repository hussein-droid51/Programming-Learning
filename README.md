# 🧩 Programming Learning Roadmap

This repository tracks my **long-term learning journey (approximately 2 years)** toward building strong foundations for **Backend, Full-Stack, and Desktop Development**.  
The roadmap follows the structure of the **Programming Advices** platform and focuses heavily on **hands-on practice and problem solving**.

The goal of this repository is documentation, consistency, and visible progress — not just watching courses, but applying what I learn.

## 🚀 Notes
- Courses are 90% practical and 10% theoretical.  
- Emphasis is on **problem-solving first**, then applying solutions with technology.  
- Extra advanced stage (yellow courses) is optional, but highly recommended for mastering modern development practices.
